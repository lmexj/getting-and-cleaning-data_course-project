* A code book containing descriptions of the variables, and explainations to each step is called "CodeBook.md". 

* The final script "run_analysis.R" will create a separate tidy data containing the average of each measurement for all experiment subjects from the original train and test cohorts.
 
* You can find the script "run_analysis.R" and its output file "Final_output.txt" in this repo.
